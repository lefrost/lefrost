### I'm currently working on:

- 🌊 `7seas` (unreleased) - Find where to watch anime/movies & read manga/novels (official/pirate/torrent platforms, ever-expanding platform database)
<!-- - 🔮 `Imon` (unreleased) - Social 'linktree', with a twist - 'Ko-Mon-Qi' system (collective value, platform cards, unique value), and heavily statistics-based -->
<!-- - 🍉 `Ye Dada!` (unreleased, on hold) - Trackable Genshin Impact primo codes, web events and possibly even more, in one tidy little place -->

### I'm currently maintaining:

- 🛎️ [`Coinsink`](https://www.coinsink.cc/) (beta) - Real-time crypto faucet aggregator and rotator (follow [Coinsink's official Twitter](https://twitter.com/coinsink) for updates)
- 📔 [`ollecss`](https://ollecss.vercel.app/) - Tiny site to store all the posts related to the [ollecss YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBDopo8825exbqCH4N-nv5A).

### Current vibe:

- 🚀 [`Svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) for feather-light frontend development; I've got my own [boilerplate](https://github.com/ollefrost/ollesvelte)
- 📜 [`MongoDB Atlas`](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for easy database hosting; I've got my own Express-powered [template](https://github.com/ollefrost/olleatlas)
- 🎈 [`Vercel`](https://github.com/vercel/vercel) and [`Heroku`](https://github.com/heroku/cli) for devil-quick site and API deployment, respectively

<!--
⚡ `I'm On` (unreleased) - Specialised links for those who play specific games, or use specific sites

**i'm lé** ✌️

so far, i've established several solo ventures and find myself doing design, development, operational and directorial work for them.

currently, i'm working on [@suave](https://twitter.com/suaveseals) and [@loop](https://twitter.com/intheloopfyi), both of which are in a phase of infancy. i enjoy the creative freedom!

during off hours, i'm mostly either writing unpublished fiction, or [indulging in](https://anilist.co/user/lefrost) japanese pop culture.

i enjoy quiet cafés, impressionist jazz, and a good romance manga. find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/lefrst) or on my [website](https://lef.la).

### I'm currently working on:

- 🛎️ `Coinsink` (unreleased) - Real-time crypto faucet rotator
- 🍉 `Ye Dada!` (unreleased) - Trackable Genshin Impact primo codes, web events and possibly even more, in one tidy little place

### Current vibe:

- 🚀 [`Svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) for feather-light frontend development; I've got my own [boilerplate](https://github.com/ollefrost/ollesvelte) too
- 🎈 [`Vercel`](https://github.com/vercel/vercel) for devil-quick site deployment
